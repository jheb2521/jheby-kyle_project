# Requirements for optional server and OpenAI integration
# - Flask: serves the frontend and exposes the /api/chat endpoint
# - openai: optional, used by the server when OPENAI_API_KEY is set

flask
openai

# The Tkinter app (`main.py`) still runs without these packages; these are only
# needed if you run `server.py` to enable secure OpenAI calls from the frontend.
